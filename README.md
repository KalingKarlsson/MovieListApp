# Movie App Mobile REST - Level 1

Your task is to build a mobile app that integrates with the Movie Catalog REST API and presents the retrieved data. Please agree with your hiring team regarding the tech stack choice.

The app should have a movie list view and a movie details view. 

Tapping on a movie on the list should open the details view for that movie. There should also be a way to navigate back to the list view from the details view.
