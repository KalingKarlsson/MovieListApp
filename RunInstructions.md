# Running locally

## version 1

1. You need to install the expo app from the app store / google play
2. Clone the repo from github
3. Do "npm install" to get needed packages
4. Type "expo start" in the terminal for the project
5. If "expo start" does not work, you might need to install expo first
6. Open up expo app and scan the QR code that pops up on the localhost or connect your device through usb cable and press "run on Android / IOS"

## Version 2

The app is already published to my expo account so you can access it from there.
